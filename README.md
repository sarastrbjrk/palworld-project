Palworld "API" and pictures (json file): https://github.com/mlg404/palworld-paldex-api 
    
## TLDR
I created a website that serves as a sneakpeak of the gaming experience of the open-world survival RPG **Palworld** created by the Japanese *Pockerpair, Inc*. 

## What have I created?
A Palworld introduction/marketing page to acquire new players (this is totally ok to do... https://www.pocketpair.jp/guidelines-derivativework). This project works as a sneakpeak of what the experience of playing palworld is like. 

## Why?

The problem? People need something meaningful to do in their free time. For gaming enthusiasts, that's not a problem, but for myself who rarely play PC or console games, I wanted something more immersive than scrolling tiktok, watching youtube, and playing hayday on my phone. I had a lovely boyfriend who then introduced me to Palworld (and based on the submission time of this project you can imagine the effect it had). Still, the fact remains, I haven't had this much fun playing a game since I got my Nintendo 3DS over 10 years ago.

## For whom?

Palworld can be enjoyed by anyone with a PC or xbox, but for the purposes of this project I imagine the general reciever of this information to be younger-ish people with some interest in games or starting to play games. 

## What is Palworld?
Palworld is a perfect first game for someone who hasn't played a lot of, but still want to get into gaming. If you don't understand why, then I've failed with this project.


## The project

So in this project I give a sneakpeak of the basic playthrough and some pals that exist in the game.
