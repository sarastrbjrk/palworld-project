## TL;DR

I created a website that serves as a sneakpeak of the open-world survival RPG **Palworld** created by the Japanese *Pockerpair, Inc*. 

## Why?

The problem? People need something meaningful to do in their free time. For gaming enthusiasts, that's not a problem, but for myself who rarely play PC or console games, I wanted something more immersive than scrolling tiktok, watching youtube, and playing hayday on my phone. I had a lovely boyfriend who then introduced me to Palworld (and based on the submission time of this project you can imagine the effect it had). Still, the fact remains, I haven't had this much fun playing a game since I got my Nintendo 3DS over 10 years ago.

Palworld can be enjoyed by anyone with a PC or xbox, but for the purposes of this project I imagine the reciever of this information to be younger-ish people with some interest in games. 

## The project

This project is a fun way get to know of the pals that exists in the game. The project includes two pages. The components are a hero, footer, a pal carousel element, and a interactive pal quiz element as well as basic text and button components. I wanted the design to be fun and colorful, but it maybe got a bit overboard with the background (and I had to keep track of the color contrast as well). 

### Tasks 

    1. Read project requirements
    2. Initial idea and moodboard in Figma
    3. Setup codespace and git
    4. Find Paldeck API and add to codespace
    5. Compress images of pals 
    6. Initial UI design, colors and fonts contrast checked at: https://www.realtimecolors.com/docs/contrast-checker?colors=e9eaeb-050708-a7bed3-2e5a83-5196d7&fonts=Inknut%20Antiqua-BioRhyme
    7. Deployed skeleton to Vercel and added CI/CD (commits to master automatically pushes new changes to deployment)
    8. Added pal "API" carousel
    9. Interactive element - pal quiz where you match pal and description
    10. Styling + finishing touches

### Limitations 
    - When I found the API I thought it was deployed (it wasn't) so what I basically did was that I copied the json-file with information on pals into my project. All the picutres are from there. 
    - the deployed vercel app didn't work for the HTML error checker, so I wasn't able to check for html errors... 
    - The interactive element i.e the quiz is probably not as "advanced" as was required, but I'm already a week overdue so this is what it ended up as (tbh I was pretty happy when I got it to work)
    - the background bothers me quite a lot but I did want it to cover the whole page, which makes it looks quite dumb on narrower screens
    - the design is very simplistic, I blame that on me being at my limit for this academic year :( )
