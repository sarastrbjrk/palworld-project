## TLDR
I created a website that serves as a sneakpeak of the gaming experience of the open-world survival RPG **Palworld** created by the Japanese *Pockerpair, Inc*. 

## What have I created?
A Palworld introduction/marketing page to acquire new players (this is totally ok to do... https://www.pocketpair.jp/guidelines-derivativework). This project works as a sneakpeak of what the experience of playing palworld is like. 

## Why?

The problem? People need something meaningful to do in their free time. For gaming enthusiasts, that's not a problem, but for myself who rarely play PC or console games, I wanted something more immersive than scrolling tiktok, watching youtube, and playing hayday on my phone. I had a lovely boyfriend who then introduced me to Palworld (and based on the submission time of this project you can imagine the effect it had). Still, the fact remains, I haven't had this much fun playing a game since I got my Nintendo 3DS over 10 years ago.

## For whom?

Palworld can be enjoyed by anyone with a PC or xbox, but for the purposes of this project I imagine the reciever of this information to be younger-ish people with some interest in games. 

## The project

So in this project I give a sneakpeak the paldeck that exist in the game. The project includes a hero, a pal carousel element, and a interactive quiz element. 

### Tasks 

    1. Read project requirements
    2. Initial idea and moodboard in Figma
    3. Setup codespace and git
    4. Find Paldeck API and add to codespace
    5. Compress images of pals 
    6. Initial UI design, colors and fonts contrast checked at: https://www.realtimecolors.com/docs/contrast-checker?colors=e9eaeb-050708-a7bed3-2e5a83-5196d7&fonts=Inknut%20Antiqua-BioRhyme
    7. Deployed skeleton to Vercel and added CI/CD (commits to master automatically pushes new changes to deployment)
    8. Added pal "API" carousel
    9. Interactive element - pal quiz where you match pal and description
    10. Styling + finishing touches

### Limitations 
    - for some reason my deployed vercel app didn't work for the HTML error checker, so I wasn't able to check for html errors... 
    - The interactive element i.e the quiz is probably not as "advanced" as was required, but I'm already a week overdue so this is what it ended up as (tbh I was pretty happy when I got it to work)
    - the background bothers me quite a lot but I did want it to cover the whole page, which makes it looks quite dumb on narrower screens
    - the design is very simple, I blame that on me being at my limit for this academic year :( )

### Total hours

    25h
