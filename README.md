## What have I created?
    A Palworld introduction/marketing page to acquire new players (this is totally ok to do... https://www.pocketpair.jp/guidelines-derivativework)

## What is Palworld?
    If you didn't understand what palworld is based on the project, then I've failed. Shortly, Palworld or "Pokemon with Guns" is a survival open-world RPG where you catch pals, build bases, explore biomes, and fight bosses. After you've caught a pal you can use it in fights and unlock their "partner" skills, e.g Relaxaurus' partner skill is a missile launcher you can unlock at level 46 (end game).
