export const pals = {
    "lamball": "A walk up a hill tends to end with this Pal tumbling back down. This causes it to become dizzy and unable to move, making it easy to capture and kill. As a result, this pal has tumbled down to the very bottom of the food chain itself.",
    "cattiva": "At a glance it appears full of confidence, but it is in fact weak and cowardly.\nBeing toyed with by a --- is in many ways the greatest of disgraces.",
    "chikipi": "Extremely weak and far too delicious. It is one of the weakest Pals. No matter how many are hunted, they just keep appearing.",
    "teafant": "Large amounts of water pour from what is thought to be its nose, though some say that it is, in fact, just snot. This has sparked a fierce debate among Pal scholars.",
    "direhowl": "Long ago this pal would hunt alongside humans but over the years this bond faded.",
    "bristla": "This prickly Pal's thorns are highly poisonous. It is friendly with Cinnamoth and only smiles when Cinnamoth is drinking its nectar.",
    "mossanda": "A Pal whose power is truly shocking. By altering the electrical currents in its body, this Pal's been able to overload its own strength. When it comes to sheer power, this Pal may be top of the list.",
    "leezpunk": "A Pal that always takes great care to maintain a stylish stance. Always on the hunt for the coolest poses, if given a mirror it will spend all day posing in front of it.",
    "robinquill": "A pal that is very similar to humans who hunt and live in the forests. It may prove to be a key for understanding what Pals are and how they diverged from humans so long ago.",
    "dinossom": "A Pal who once angered cannot be pacified. It rages on and on like an inferno. The phrase \"step on a ---'s tail\" has come to mean enraging someone.",
    "tombat": "Often appears out of the blue to flaunt its prized wings in front of other Pals.\nAlthough it seems to be an intimidation tactic, the Pal seems to derive some kind of pleasure from the display.",
    "katress": "With the power of shadows it produces arcane phenomena. It prefers to eat food raw and is particularly hostile towards Wixen.",
    "relaxaurus": "Contrary to its blase appearance, it's quite ferocious.\nIt perceives everything in its sight as prey and will stop at nothing to devour it.",
    "kingpaca": "Melpaca serve this Pal.\nContests between --- offer up their vassals as a wager. Those seen alone are losers of such contests.",
    "mammorest": "The vegetation on its back varies between individuals. There is a long history of appreciating this veritable garden of a Pal, and there are even Mammorest pruning specialists.",
    "quivern": "Sleeping while cuddling a --- is said to be a heavenly experience, but there are some who have been crushed and sent to heaven by ones that toss and turn in their sleep."
